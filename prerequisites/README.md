# Prerequisites

Before we get started with Docker in Ubuntu or on Azure we need to install a few things locally, so we have a commandline tool we can use for interacting with both of these. 
This involves installing and configuring git on your local machine, setting up Cmder as our local git shell and getting the Docker binaries.

* [Installing and configuring git](git/README.md) - please note that its important that your Windows PATH is configured correctly.
* [Getting and configuring Cmder](cmder/README.md)
* [Getting and configuring Docker binaries](docker/README.md)

You can also setup a local Docker lab by using the newly released [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox) (Toolbox deprecates Boot2Docker), 
which includes the Docker Client, Machine, Kitematic (the Docker GUI) and VirtualBox. Full documentation for installing the Docker Toolbox on Windows 
is available on [https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/)
